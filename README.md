# Movie-Recommender


The Movie Recommender project is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) that provides users with a comprehensive movie search and viewing experience.

## Key Features

- **Movie Search**: 
  - Users can search for their favorite movies using a third-party movie API (e.g., The Movie Database API).
  - The application fetches relevant movie data based on the user's search query.

- **Detailed Movie Information**: 
  - Displays detailed information for each movie, including title, release date, synopsis, cast, ratings, and more.
  - Helps users learn more about the movies they are interested in.

- **Responsive Design**: 
  - Fully responsive design ensures a seamless experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: 
  - Built using React.js for a dynamic and interactive experience.
  - Easy navigation and access to information.

- **Backend Integration**: 
  - Backend powered by Node.js and Express.js to handle API requests, process data, and manage server-side logic.

- **Database Management**: 
  - Uses MongoDB for storing user data and other relevant information.
  - Provides a robust and scalable database solution.

## Technical Stack

- **MongoDB**: 
  - A NoSQL database used for storing user data and application information.
  
- **Express.js**: 
  - A web application framework for Node.js, used to build the server-side logic and handle API requests.

- **React.js**: 
  - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to create the frontend of the application.

- **Node.js**: 
  - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, used to build the server-side of the application.

## How It Works

1. **User Search**: 
   - Users enter a movie name into the search bar.
   
2. **API Request**: 
   - The application sends a request to a third-party movie API to fetch movie data matching the search query.

3. **Data Display**: 
   - Retrieved movie data is displayed in a user-friendly format, showing key details about each movie.

4. **Detailed View**: 
   - Users can click on a movie to view more detailed information.
